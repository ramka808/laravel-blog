## How to run blog locally? 

Clone the project:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gomzyakov/laravel-blog.git
```

I believe you already have Docker installed. If not, just do it on [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/).

Build the `laravel-blog` image with the following command:

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
```

>This command might take a few minutes to complete.

When the build is finished, you can run the environment in background mode with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Weâ€™ll now run `composer install` to install the application dependencies:

```bash
docker compose exec app composer install
```

Copy the environment settings:

```bash
docker compose exec app cp .env.local .env
```

Set encryption key with the `artisan` Laravel command-line tool:

```bash
docker compose exec app ./artisan key:generate --ansi
```

Migrate DB & seed fake data:

```bash
docker compose exec app ./artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

And add Filament admin user:

```bash
docker compose exec app ./artisan make:filament-user
```

And open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your favorite browser. Happy using Laravel Blog!

## How to get inside the container?

```bash
docker exec -ti laravel-blog-app bash
